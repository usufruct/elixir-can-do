## Add Something Module
Create a module with an `increase_by/1` function. This function takes an integer and returns a function which takes a single argument. This function will return the value originally passed to `increase_by` to the value passed to it.

After this module is created, import the module into the iex shell. Then create a function `add7`. Use `add7` a few times to show that the function works.

## Insertion Sort
Create a module with a 'sort_letters/1' function. This function takes a string and iterates it in order, placing each item in the string in its sort position. After each item is processed print the partail sort results. At the end of processing print the final sorted string.

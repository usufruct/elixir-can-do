## Add Something Module
Create a module with an `increase_by/1` function. This function takes an integer and returns a function which takes a single argument. This function will return the value originally passed to `increase_by` to the value passed to it.

After this module is created, import the module into the iex shell. Then create a function `add7`. Use `add7` a few times to show that the function works.
